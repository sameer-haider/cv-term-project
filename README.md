# cv-term-project
This is the term project for my Computer Vision class taught by Ranran Feng at UTD. This project is a collaborative effort between me and Sanjith Chockan.

Used **openCV** library to classify images into 3 different categories. Extracted SIFT features, used various models, and achieved decent accuracy.
